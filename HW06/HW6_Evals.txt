Because you used recursion, your Fibonacci program has
trouble stopping when I run several of the tests.  The
only one of my tests that works is to find the 23rd number.
Finding the 35th number takes about 25 seconds. and finding
the 40th number ran for 4 minutes but got an answer.
Java Fibonacci 100 ran for nearly 10 minutes without
getting a result, so I killed it.  I didn't even try 250,
1000, or 10000.... there isn't that much time in a weekend.

Minimum three files in repo (3)     : 3 points
